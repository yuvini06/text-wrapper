# CO222: Programming Methodology (Lab 08)

## Description: 
A C implementation of a program that shows a given text wrapped on the screen. The idea of word wrap is to adjust the presentation of text content with the constrained “Maximum Width”. Maximum width is the number of characters you are allowed to display in a single line including spaces. 

## Constraints:
- The program is not allowed to break a word into halves while displaying. If displaying any current word exceeds the maximum width, the program will go to next line and print the word to avoid splitting words into pieces.
- Obviously, the program is not allowed to print more characters than the maximum width in a single line.
